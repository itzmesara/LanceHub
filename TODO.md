# Authentication Fix - TODO List

## Steps to Fix Authentication Issue

1. [x] Update SecurityConfig.java to restore proper authentication
   - Remove `.anyRequest().permitAll()` 
   - Add proper authorization rules
   - Add JwtAuthenticationFilter to security chain
   - Configure public endpoints properly

2. [x] Add proper security annotations to controllers
   - [x] ClientProfileController - @PreAuthorize annotations
   - [x] ProjectController - @PreAuthorize annotations  
   - [x] ApplicationController - @PreAuthorize annotations
   - [x] FreelancerProfileController - already has proper annotations

3. [x] Fix SecurityConfig conflict
   - [x] Removed public access rule for `/api/projects` that was conflicting with @PreAuthorize annotations

4. [ ] Restart backend server to apply security changes
   - The backend needs to be restarted for @PreAuthorize annotations to take effect

5. [ ] Test the authentication flow
   - Verify login/logout works
   - Check that protected routes require authentication
   - Confirm reload maintains user session

6. [ ] Verify public endpoints remain accessible
   - Auth endpoints (/api/auth/**)
   - Public GET requests
   - CORS preflight requests

## Current Status: Ready for Step 4 - Restart Backend
