# Registration Fix Summary

## Problem
The frontend was sending a `name` field in the registration request, but the backend's RegisterRequest DTO didn't expect this field, causing a JSON parse error:
```
"JSON parse error: Unrecognized field 'name' (class com.launcehub.dto.RegisterRequest), not marked as ignorable"
```

## Solution
Updated the backend to properly handle the `name` field in registration requests:

### Files Modified:

1. **RegisterRequest.java** - Added `name` field with validation
2. **Users.java** - Added `name` field to the User entity
3. **UserService.java** - Updated to set the name field during user registration and authentication
4. **AuthResponse.java** - Added `name` field to include in authentication responses
5. **UserController.java** - Updated to include name in user profile responses

### Changes Made:

#### 1. RegisterRequest DTO
- Added `name` field with validation annotations:
  - `@NotBlank(message = "Name is required")`
  - `@Size(min = 2, max = 50, message = "Name must be between 2 and 50 characters")`

#### 2. Users Entity
- Added `name` field as a required column:
  - `@Column(nullable = false)`
  - `String name;`

#### 3. UserService
- **registerUser()**: Added `user.setName(registerRequest.getName());`
- **authenticateUser()**: Updated AuthResponse constructor to include name

#### 4. AuthResponse DTO
- Added `name` field
- Updated constructor to accept name parameter
- Updated all constructor calls throughout the application

#### 5. UserController
- Updated `/api/users/me` endpoint to include name in response

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Registration now accepts `name` field without JSON parse errors
- ✅ Name is stored in the database with the user
- ✅ Name is returned in authentication responses (login/register)
- ✅ Name is available in user profile endpoints
- ✅ All existing functionality remains intact

## Testing
The registration should now work correctly with the following JSON payload:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "FREELANCER"
}
```

The response will include the name field:
```json
{
  "token": "jwt_token_here",
  "type": "Bearer",
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "FREELANCER"
}
```

## Database Impact
- A new `name` column has been added to the `users` table
- Existing users will have `null` values for the name field until updated
- New registrations will populate the name field correctly

The fix ensures that the frontend registration form with the name field will work seamlessly with the backend.
